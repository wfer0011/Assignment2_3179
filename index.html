                <p id="linespacing">Humans taking over the Earth's natural systems is impacting air and water quality around the world. Pollution is a global problem. It is now everywhere, from the soil we walk on to the air we breathe. Plastic pollution is now one of the most dangerous issues the earth is facing right now. Plastic is ubiquitous in our everyday lives. Some plastics we can reuse or recycle—and many play important roles in areas like medicine and public safety—but other items such as straws, cups bottles are designed for only one use. In fact, more than 40 percent of plastic is used only once before it is thrown away, where it lingers in the environment for a long, long time. It often breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, called microplastics, which can be ingested by both animals and people. At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, and plastic makes up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments.
                 Marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and death.</p>

                Almost all plastic garbage in developed countries is burnt, recycled, or disposed of in well-managed landfills. It is not exposed to the outside world. Low-to-middle-income countries typically have inadequate waste handling facilities. Waste can be placed outside of landfills, and those that do exist are frequently open, spilling waste into the environment.
                Mismanaged waste is thus considerably more prevalent in low-to-middle-income countries.

                The Philippines accounts for more than one-third (36%) of plastic inputs, which is not surprising given that it is home to seven of the top ten rivers in the world. This is due to the fact that the Philippines is made up of many small islands, with the majority of the population living near the coast. This is true for many islands and countries with coastlines. Richer countries, on the other hand, have superior waste management systems, resulting in lower waste emissions to the oceans.

       <br>
Hong Kong is frequently used as an entrance point for Chinese imports, making it the largest 'exporting' country to China. Many high-income countries are represented in the top ten list,all of which are big plastic exporters.These countries account for around 76% of total imports.

        <br>
        The world now generates twice as much plastic waste as it did two decades ago, with the majority of it ending up in landfills, incinerated, or leaking into the environment.
        Since the 1950s, the world's plastic production has been rapidly increasing, with no signs of slowing any time soon.

        <b class="diffcolor">How does the GDP affect the plastic waste ?</b>
        <br>
        Countries with higher GDPs tend to have a lesser chance of having a high percentage of waste emittance to the ocean due to the 
        better waste management systems they have.Therefore poorer countries tend to have a higher percentage of waste emitance to oceans.
        Sri Lankan and Philippines are examples.
